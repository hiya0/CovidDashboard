# CovidDashboard
A website which tracks the total coronavirus cases, deaths and new cases by country. Additionally, a map view is provided for the same,including information about the provinces too. With the use of map and charts, visualization of data, it becomes easy to understand the data retrieved from the API. The website was developed using React.js, Material-UI, Chart.js and MapBox. While developing this website I've taken inspiration from YouTube tutorials.
